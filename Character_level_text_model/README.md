A character level model used to predict the next character given a sequence of charaters. This helps to build our own new stories. The model was trained on a small part of shakespear text. We can futher train and process it to give more meaningful results.

We can skip the model training by specifying the parameter skip_training = True. For that we need to load the 'models' folder in the working directory to get a pretrained model.
